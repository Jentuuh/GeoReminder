# GeoReminder
A simple Android application that lets you create reminders for chosen locations. You can simply choose a 'reminder message' and pin out a location on the map. The application will then locally save this location, and will notify you whenever you enter a certain range around the specified location. 

The application uses Google's Geofences, Maps API and Room Database.

# Test Usage
If you'd like to try out the application: Install Android Studio --> Clone this repository --> Import this project in Android Studio --> Plug your Android device into your PC --> In Android Studio, under 'Available Devices', select your device --> Run the application.
